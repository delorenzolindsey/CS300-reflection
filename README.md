# CS300-reflection
This is to discuss what I learn over the course and add example of my coding growth through projects

In this submition I have Added my project 1 psuedocode and my project 2 source.cpp and csv it reads in order for it to run.

Now I will discuss the questions for hte assignment.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Students had to solve not only practicing their coding ablitiy in life like example, but to solve the runtime of their projects created. 
This thinking is need for future projects that companies can us later. 
The problem later for the project to look at the runtimes and select which is best for the project.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I aproach the how to pick which runtime for the final project 2 by looking at the pseudocode for project 1.
It made us look at the runtimes of each; vector, tree, and hashtable. With not too much data needed to be supported in the file the vector was the best chioce.
I chioce a vector because of its fast runtime and quick search abilities.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I at first really struggled with runtimes. After getting lost in reading, I would search online for videos to help explain it simplier.
After many videos and read, I think I have a better understanding of O runtimes throughout systems.
It makes sense that more functions such as while(), if(), and creating vectors can create their own runtimes each.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It expanded my knowledge by helping me think about the time it takes for running a program. All my other classes so far were just teaching me the basics of the
languages and this one changed that. I finally to not only think of how to program, but how to do it with the best results.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I do not think I myself evolved much in writing programs, but more so understanding programs. 
It is important to understand how a computer works in order to program like one.
